# ECE 760 Robotics: Course Project

This repo contains all of the files for the course project of ECE 760 Robotics. The project studies the kinematics, dynamics and controller design for the PSM from dVRK. For the dynamics, a simple model without friction is considered just for simulation, instead of practical implementation.

The code is dependent on the Robotics Toolbox for Matlab (P.I. Corke, Robotics, Vision \& Control: Fundamental Algorithms in MATLAB. Second edition. Springer, 2017. ISBN 978-3-319-54413-7.).
